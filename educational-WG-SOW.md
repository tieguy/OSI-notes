# Management Education Working Group
## Rationale
Mainstream management education is only superficially engaging with the evolution of successful free/libre/open source software development methodologies. Widely used educational materials — such as the PMP (Project Management Professional) and PRINCE2 (Projects in Controlled Environments, v.2) certifications — do not effectively address open source issues, including ethics, methods, processes, governance, HR management, corporate strategy, law, and financing.
OSI would like to charter a working group to address this gap, in order to fulfill its mission by helping educate the public, and management of technology organizations, about the benefits of open source.
